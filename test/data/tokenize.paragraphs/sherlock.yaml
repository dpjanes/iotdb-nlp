    Sherlock Holmes took his bottle from the corner of the mantelpiece and his
    hypodermic syringe from its neat morocco case. With his long, white, nervous
    fingers he adjusted the delicate needle, and rolled back his left
    shirt-cuff. For some little time his eyes rested thoughtfully upon the
    sinewy forearm and wrist all dotted and scarred with innumerable
    puncture-marks. Finally he thrust the sharp point home, pressed down the
    tiny piston, and sank back into the velvet-lined arm-chair with a long sigh
    of satisfaction.

    custom had not reconciled my mind to it. On the contrary, from day to day I
    had become more irritable at the sight, and my conscience swelled nightly
    within me at the thought that I had lacked the courage to protest. Again and
    again I had registered a vow that I should deliver my soul upon the subject,
    but there was that in the cool, nonchalant air of my companion which made
    him the last man with whom one would care to take anything approaching to a
    liberty. His great powers, his masterly manner, and the experience which I
    had had of his many extraordinary qualities, all made me diffident and
    backward in crossing him.

    Yet upon that afternoon, whether it was the Beaune which I had taken with my
    lunch, or the additional exasperation produced by the extreme deliberation
    of his manner, I suddenly felt that I could hold out no longer.

    He raised his eyes languidly from the old black-letter volume which he had
    opened. “It is cocaine,” he said,—“a seven-per-cent solution. Would you care
    to try it?”

    “No, indeed,” I answered, brusquely. “My constitution has not got over the
    Afghan campaign yet. I cannot afford to throw any extra strain upon it.”
